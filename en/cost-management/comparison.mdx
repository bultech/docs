# Comparing Cost Tables

The comparison tool allows you to analyze the differences and variances between your different cost management tables (e.g., an Estimation table and a Budget table) by bringing them side-by-side.

## How to Make a Comparison

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Comparison Tool">
    While on the **Estimation** or **Budget** page, click the **Compare** (<img src="/icons/compare.svg" alt="compare" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />) icon next to the title of the table you want to compare.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the Tables">
    In the window that opens, select the other cost table you want to compare from the list next to your current table.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the Comparison">
    When you place a table in both panes, the system creates a new comparison record by comparing these two tables.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Saved Comparisons

Comparisons you create are saved and can be reviewed later.

- **Access:** When you open the comparison window, previously created comparison pairs appear at the top of the list.
- **Actions:**
    - **View:** You can view the two tables side-by-side again by clicking on a saved comparison.
    - **Delete:** You can delete a record with the **Delete** (<img src="/icons/delete-outline.svg" alt="delete-outline" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />) icon that appears when you hover over a comparison record.
