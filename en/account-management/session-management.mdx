# Session Management

To ensure the security of your account, you can track which devices and browsers have active sessions and remotely terminate sessions you don't recognize or no longer use.

## Accessing Session Management

This feature is located within the [General Settings Panel](/en/general-settings/settings-panel).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open General Settings">
    Click the **Settings** (<img src="/icons/cog-outline.svg" alt="cog-outline" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />) option from your [user card](/en/account-management/user-card) in the left menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to the Sessions Tab">
    Click the **Sessions** tab in the panel that opens.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Sessions

In the Sessions tab, you will see a list of all devices where your account has an active session.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Session Information">
    The following information is listed for each session:
    - **Device Type and Browser:** The device (e.g., Mac OS) and browser (e.g., Chrome) where the session was opened.
    - **Location:** The city and country where the session was opened (estimated based on IP address).
    - **Last Active Time:** When the session was last active.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Terminating a Session">
    To terminate a session on a device you don't recognize or no longer use, you can use the "**Log Out**" button next to the relevant row. This action only closes the session on the selected device and does not affect your current session.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  If you suspect your account security is compromised, it is recommended to [change your password](/en/account-management/change-password) after logging out of all other sessions.
