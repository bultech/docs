# User Card and Quick Access

At the bottom of the left navigation menu, there is a personal user card that is always visible. This card is designed to provide quick access to basic account information and actions.

## Card Components

- **Profile Picture:** Displays the profile picture you have uploaded.
- **Full Name:** Displays your full name as registered in your account.
- **Email Address:** Displays the email address you use to log in to your account.

## Quick Access Menu

When you hover over or click on the user card, a menu with a series of quick actions opens:

1.  **Profile (<img src="/icons/account-circle-outline.svg" alt="account-circle-outline" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />):**
    *   Directs you to your [Edit Profile](/en/account-management/edit-profile) page.
