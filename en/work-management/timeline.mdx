# Using the Timeline (Gantt Chart)

The Timeline view allows you to see the start and end dates, durations, and interdependencies of tasks and epics in your projects on a visual calendar. This is a powerful tool for project planning and tracking.

## Interface Structure

The page consists of two main sections:
- **Task List (Left Panel):** All epics and tasks in the project are listed in a hierarchical structure.
- **Timeline (Right Panel):** The main calendar area containing horizontal bars representing tasks positioned according to their start and end dates.

## Basic Operations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Adjusting Dates and Durations">
    - **Drag and Move:** You can change the start and end dates of a task simultaneously by dragging its bar left or right on the timeline.
    - **Drag to Extend/Shorten:** You can adjust the duration of a task by dragging the right or left edge of its bar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reordering Tasks">
    In the task list on the left panel, you can change the order of a task or epic by dragging it up or down.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Moving a Task Under an Epic">
    You can make a standalone task a sub-task of an epic by dragging it from the list in the left panel and dropping it onto an epic.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Timeline Controls">
    - **Zoom In/Out (`+`/`-`):** Allows you to increase or decrease the level of detail on the timeline.
    - **Today:** Focuses the timeline on the current day.
    - **Go to Start:** Focuses the timeline on the beginning of the project.
    - **Year Range:** Allows you to select the year range to be displayed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
**Note:** All changes you make on the timeline (date, duration, order, etc.) are automatically saved and reflected in the task's details.
