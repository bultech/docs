# Right Menu and Contextual Tools

Unlike the left menu, the right menu is not static; it is a dynamic toolbar that changes based on the page and context you are in. It usually contains actions, filters, or additional information related to your current task.

## Structure of the Right Menu

The right menu generally consists of the following sections:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Project Selection and Information">
    At the top, there is a card showing the name and basic information of your current project. This card constantly reminds you of the project context you are working in.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Global Actions">
    This section contains the main actions for the page you are on. These actions vary depending on the purpose of the page.
    - **Example (Detailed Budget):** Buttons like "Toggle Edit Mode", "Filter", "Export to Excel" are available.
    - **Example (Project Team):** The "Add New Team Member" button is located here.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Contextual Navigation">
    On some pages, there is a navigation menu that allows you to quickly switch to related sub-sections.
    - **Example (Project Settings):** While on the "Work Breakdown Structure" page, a sub-menu allows you to switch between "Cost Code" and "Cost Type".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DinoBot AI Quick Access">
    At the very bottom of the right menu is the **Bul icon** (<img src="/images/chatBot.svg" alt="chatbot" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />). Clicking this icon opens the [DinoBot AI Assistant](/en/general-features/dinobot-ai).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Hiding/Showing the Menu

You can hide the right menu and expand your workspace by clicking the **double arrow** (<img src="/icons/chevron-double-right.svg" alt="chevron-double-right" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} /> or <img src="/icons/chevron-double-left.svg" alt="chevron-double-left" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />) icon on the left edge of the right menu. You can bring the menu back by clicking the same icon again when it's hidden.
