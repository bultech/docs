# Support Center and Help

When you encounter any issues, have a question, or need technical support within the platform, you can easily reach the Support Center.

## Accessing the Support Center

To access the Support Center, simply click on the **Help Icon** (<img src="/icons/help-circle-outline.svg" alt="help-circle-outline" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />) located at the bottom of the left menu, just above your user profile card.

## Support Options

When you click the icon, the Intercom support window will open. Through this window, you can perform the following actions:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
