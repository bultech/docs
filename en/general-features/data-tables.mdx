# Interacting with Data Tables

Many of the platform's modules use powerful and interactive tables to manage data. This section provides basic information on how to interact with these tables.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Edit Mode">
    Most cost and settings tables are in a "locked" or "read-only" mode by default to prevent accidental data changes.

    - **Activation:** To enter or edit data, you usually need to activate **Edit Mode** (<img src="/icons/lock-open-variant-outline.svg" alt="lock-open-variant-outline" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />) by clicking the **lock** (<img src="/icons/lock-outline.svg" alt="lock-outline" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />) icon, typically found in the top-right corner of the table.
    - **Data Entry:** While in edit mode, you can directly enter data or change existing data by clicking on the cells in the table.
    - **Adding a New Row:** When you start filling in the empty row at the bottom of the table, the system automatically adds a new empty row below it.
    - **Saving:** The data you enter is usually saved automatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Row Actions and Context Menu">
    In many tables, you can use the right-click menu to perform actions on a specific row.

    **Common Right-Click Actions:**
    - **Delete Row:** Permanently deletes the selected row (usually requires confirmation).
    - **Export:** Exports the data of the selected row to PDF or another format.
    - **View Details:** Opens a window with more details about the row.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Managing Columns and Views">
    Especially in complex tables like the Detailed Budget, you can customize which columns you see.

    - **Manage Table View (<img src="/icons/table-eye.svg" alt="table-eye" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />):** Clicking this icon opens a list of all available columns. You can instantly customize the table by selecting the columns you want to see and save this view for later use.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Adjusting Column Width">
    Go to a column header and move your mouse to the right edge of the header. When the cursor changes to a resize icon, you can click and drag to adjust the column's width.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  **Authorization:**
  - **Edit Mode:** A user's ability to activate "Edit Mode" requires them to have "Edit" or higher [permissions](/en/platform-rules/roles-and-permissions-rbac) for that module.
  - **Row Actions:** The actions that appear in the right-click menu (e.g., Delete Row) vary depending on whether the user has the necessary permissions for that action.
