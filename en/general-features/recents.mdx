# Recents

The "Recents" feature allows you to quickly return to the pages and items you have most recently visited within the platform. This makes it easier to navigate between frequently used project pages or modules.

## Accessing Recents

This feature is located in the **[Spotlight Search](/en/general-features/spotlight-search)** interface.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Spotlight">
    Open Spotlight using the shortcut `CTRL + K` (Windows) or `âŒ˜ + K` (macOS).
  </Step>
  <Step title="View the List">
    When the search bar is empty, a list of your most recently visited pages automatically appears under the "Recents" heading.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to the Page">
    You can go directly to a page by selecting an item from the list with the keyboard arrow keys and pressing `Enter`, or by clicking on it with the mouse.
