# Magic Bar: Contextual Action Bar

The Magic Bar is a dynamic toolbar that appears at the bottom of the screen in a specific context (for example, when you select multiple items in a table), presenting relevant actions you can perform at that moment.

## Activating the Magic Bar

The Magic Bar automatically appears in situations where you can perform bulk actions. The most common use case is selecting multiple rows in a table.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to a List View">
    For example, go to the **List View** on the **Work Management** page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Multiple Items">
    Check the checkboxes next to multiple tasks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View the Magic Bar">
    As soon as you make a selection, the Magic Bar will appear at the bottom-center of the screen.
  </Step>

<Note>
  **Authorization:** The action buttons visible on the Magic Bar change dynamically based on the user's [roles and permissions](/en/platform-rules/roles-and-permissions-rbac). For example, if a user does not have "Delete" permission, the delete (<img src="/icons/trash-can-outline.svg" alt="trash-can-outline" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />) icon will not appear on the Magic Bar even if they make a bulk selection.
