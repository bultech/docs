# Spotlight Search

Spotlight is a powerful search and command tool that allows you to quickly access almost everything on the platform with keyboard shortcuts. Instead of using menus to navigate between pages or go to a specific project or setting, you can use Spotlight.

## How to Use Spotlight

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Spotlight">
    Open the search bar using the following keyboard shortcut:
    - **Windows/Linux:** `CTRL + K`
    - **macOS:** `⌘ + K`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search">
    Start typing the name of the page, project, or feature you want to go to. As you type, matching results are listed instantly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to the Result">
    Navigate through the results using the arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`) and press `Enter` to go to the selected result.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip title="Recents">
  When the search bar is empty, a list of your most recently visited pages appears. This feature allows you to quickly return to frequently used pages. For more information, see the [Recents](/en/general-features/recents) page.
</Tip>

## Example Uses

- To go to a specific project's budget page: `Project Name Budget`
- To go to the company team management page: `Team`
- To find a specific setting: `Project Settings`
