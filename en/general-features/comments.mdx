# Comments and Communication

In many parts of the platform, you can use the comment feature to communicate with team members about a specific item (task, report, etc.). The comment section is usually located at the bottom of an item's detail panel or page.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Making a Comment">
    1.  **Text Editor:** Use the rich text editor to write your comment. You can format your text (bold, italic), create lists, and add links.
    2.  **Add Comment Button:** After writing your comment, send it by clicking the "**Add Comment**" (or similar) button.
    3.  **Notification:** When your comment is posted, a notification is sent to people following the item or mentioned (`@mention`) in the comment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Viewing and Managing Comments">
    - **Comment List:** All comments added to an item are sorted from newest to oldest.
    - **User Information:** Next to each comment, the profile picture, name of the person who made the comment, and how long ago it was made are displayed.
    - **Editing and Deleting:** When you hover over a comment you made, **Edit** (<img src="/icons/comment-edit-outline.svg" alt="comment-edit-outline" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />) and **Delete** (<img src="/icons/trash-can-outline.svg" alt="trash-can-outline" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />) icons usually appear.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tagging Users (@mention)">
    When commenting, you can use the `@` symbol to directly notify a specific person.

    1.  Type `@` in the comment field.
    2.  A list of users from your project or company team will appear.
    3.  Select the user you want to tag from the list or continue typing their name.
    4.  When the comment is posted, the user you tagged will receive a special notification.
  </Accordion>

<Note>
  **Authorization Note:** The permissions to view, create, edit, and delete comments depend on the user's [roles and permissions](/en/platform-rules/roles-and-permissions-rbac). For example, an administrator with "Delete Comments" permission can also delete others' comments.
