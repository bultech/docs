# Limits and Restrictions

The Bul Tech platform may include certain usage limits based on different subscription plans and company structures. These limits are in place to ensure system performance and fair use.

## Basic Limits

Below is a list of some basic limits and restrictions you may encounter across the platform. These limits may vary depending on your company's subscription type.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Project Limit">
    **Rule:** An approved company can create a certain number of active projects within its subscription plan.

    **Example:** In a standard plan, a company can have a maximum of **5 active projects** at the same time. When this limit is reached, one of the existing projects must be deactivated or archived to create a new one.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User Limit (Per Company)">
    **Rule:** Each company has a maximum number of users it can invite or add, based on its subscription plan.

    **Example:** If a company's user limit is **20**, the system will issue a warning when you try to invite the 21st user.

    **Related Section:** [Company Team Management](/en/team-management/company-team)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User Limit (Per Project)">
    **Rule:** Each project may have a maximum number of users that can be included in its team. This is usually linked to the company limit.

    **Example:** If a project's maximum team member count is set to **15**, the 16th user cannot be assigned to the project.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="File Upload Size">
    **Rule:** There is a maximum size for a single file that can be uploaded to the platform.

    **Example:** The maximum size for a single file upload might be **100 MB**. You will receive an error message for larger files.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Total Storage Space">
    **Rule:** Each company has a total storage space quota for all its projects.

    **Example:** If a company's total storage space is **10 GB**, no new files can be uploaded once this quota is reached.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What Happens When a Limit is Exceeded?

When you reach a limit, the platform usually displays a warning message that prevents you from performing the relevant action. For example, if you reach the project limit, the "Add New Project" button may become inactive or a notification window may appear when you click it.
