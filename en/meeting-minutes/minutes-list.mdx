# Meeting Minutes (Preview)

This module allows you to plan and record your project meetings and automatically generate minutes with AI support.

## Accessing the Page

While inside the relevant project, simply click the **Meeting Minutes** (<img src="/icons/calendar-outline.svg" alt="calendar-outline" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />) icon in the left menu.

## Interface Views

This page allows you to view your meetings in two different modes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Calendar View (Default)" icon="calendar-month-outline">
    Visualizes your meetings on a monthly, weekly, or daily calendar. You can click on an event to go to the details.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Table View" icon="table-large">
    Lists all your meeting minutes in a table format with their details.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  In both views, you can go to the [new meeting scheduling](/en/meeting-minutes/minutes-creation-editing) form with the blue "**Create Meeting Minute**" button in the top right corner of the page.

## Important Notes

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Authorization">
        The actions of creating new minutes, and viewing, editing, and deleting existing ones are subject to the user's [roles and permissions](/en/platform-rules/roles-and-permissions-rbac).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Visibility">
        Users can generally only see the meetings they have created or are added to as a participant. Roles with broader permissions, such as Project Manager, can view all meetings in the project.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
