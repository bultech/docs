## Calendar View

This page defaults to a monthly calendar view. Each day on the calendar contains colored indicators that summarize the status of the reports for that day.

    - **Green (`APPROVED`):** Indicates that all reports for that day have been approved.
    - **Yellow (`PENDING`):** Indicates that there are reports pending approval.
    - **Red (`REJECTED`):** Indicates that there are rejected reports.
    - **Black (`ALL`):** If reporting settings are off, it simply indicates that an entry was made on that day.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Interface Elements">
    - **Date Navigation (Top Left):** Allows you to switch between months, weeks, or days and return to the current day.
    - **View Options (Top Right):** Allows you to change the calendar's display range (Month/Week/Day) or switch to agenda mode.
  </Accordion>

## Important Notes

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Authorization">
        The actions of viewing, creating, editing, and deleting daily reports are subject to the user's [roles and permissions](/en/platform-rules/roles-and-permissions-rbac).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Visibility">
        Users can generally only see the reports entered by their own company or the subcontractors they are responsible for. Roles with broader permissions, such as Project Manager, can view all reports in the project.
