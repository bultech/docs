## Interface Components

This page consists of two main tabs:

### 1. Add Balance (Checkout)

This tab allows you to add balance to your company account.

### 2. Transactions

This tab provides a list of all financial transactions related to your company.

- **Transaction Table:**
    *   **Date:** Shows the date the transaction was made.
    *   **Description:** Specifies what the transaction is about (e.g., "Balance Top-up," "Monthly Subscription Fee").
    *   **Amount:** Shows the financial value of the transaction.
    *   **Status:** Indicates the status of the transaction (e.g., "Successful," "Failed," "Pending").
