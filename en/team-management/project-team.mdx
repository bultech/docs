## Important Notes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Role Overriding">
    Roles assigned to a user at the project level will override that user's company-wide roles **for that project only**. For example, you can grant "Edit" permission in this project to a user who has "View Only" permission company-wide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User Limit">
    The number of users that can be added to projects may be limited according to your company's subscription plan. For detailed information, you can review the [Limits and Restrictions](/en/platform-rules/limits-and-restrictions) page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authorization">
    Only users with [appropriate roles](/en/platform-rules/roles-and-permissions-rbac) (e.g., Project Manager, Company Owner) can manage the project team.
  </Accordion>
