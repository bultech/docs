# AI Chat Page

The AI Chat page is a full-screen artificial intelligence assistant interface where you can interact with all your project's data in a deep and focused way. This page allows for the features offered by the [DinoBot AI Assistant](/en/general-features/dinobot-ai) to be used in a larger workspace.

## Accessing the Chat Page

While inside the relevant project, simply click the **AI Chat** (<img src="/icons/chat-outline.svg" alt="chat-outline" className="inline align-middle dark:invert" style={{width: '16px', height: '16px', margin: 0}} />) icon in the left menu.
